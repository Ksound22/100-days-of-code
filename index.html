Not only that, he was a true sportsman, as he proved in applauding Alex Stepney for his save in the European Cup final. I feel proud to have been both an opponent and friend and am saddened to hear of his passing. My thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time.</p><cite> – Manchester United and England Legend, Sir Bobby Charlton</cite></blockquote>
